/**
 * @file
 * RTE Ring
 *
 * The Ring Manager is a fixed-size queue, implemented as a table of
 * pointers. Head and tail pointers are modified atomically, allowing
 * concurrent access to it. It has the following features:
 *
 * - FIFO (First In First Out)
 * - Maximum size is fixed; the pointers are stored in a table.
 * - Lockless implementation.
 * - Multi- or single-consumer dequeue.
 * - Multi- or single-producer enqueue.
 *
 * Note: the ring implementation is not preemptable. A lcore must not
 * be interrupted by another task that uses the same ring.

 * The new ring size is set to *count*, which must be a power of
 * two. Water marking is disabled by default. The real usable ring size
 * is *count-1* instead of *count* to differentiate a free ring from an

 *   The name of the ring.
 * @param count
 *   The size of the ring (must be a power of 2).
 * @param socket_id
 *   The *socket_id* argument is the socket identifier in case of
 *   NUMA. The value can be *SOCKET_ID_ANY* if there is no NUMA
 *   constraint for the reserved zone.
 * @param flags
 *   An OR of the following:
 *    - RING_F_SP_ENQ: If this flag is set, the default behavior when
 *      using ``rte_ring_enqueue()`` or ``rte_ring_enqueue_bulk()``

 *      is "single-consumer". Otherwise, it is "multi-consumers".
 * @return

 *    rte_errno set appropriately. Possible errno values include:
 *    - E_RTE_NO_CONFIG - function could not get pointer to rte_config structure

 *    - EINVAL - count provided is not a power of 2
 *    - ENOSPC - the maximum number of memzones has already been allocated
 *    - EEXIST - a memzone with the same name already exists
